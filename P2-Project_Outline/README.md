## Submission Instructions

### Overview
A few years ago I wrote a program that would take user created Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge decks (GBA game) and run a tourament that users could watch on Twitch.tv with them. The program required users to navigate to multiple websites and jump through a lot of hoops to do this though, which always felt very obtuse. I want to write a web app to centralize the user experience of creating, editing, and viewing decks.
### Features
User login: Users will be able to log-in with their Twitch.tv accounts.
Deck creation and editing: Users will be able to create and edit new decks.
Statistic tracking: Users will be able to see various stats on how their decks preform.
Embedded Twitch Interface: Users will be able to view the game and access the deck editor without having to navigate to other websites.
